                <span>The Product Sales example shows the summary of AdventureWorks sales, grouped
                    by product category over a four-year period. The cross table represents an aggregate
                    of over 121,000 data rows.

                    <span>The table is a generalized layout report item that displays report data in cells
                    that are organized into rows and columns. Report data can be detail data as it is
                    retrieved from the data source, or aggregated detail data organized into groups
                    that you specify. </span>

                    The table, crosstab, and list report items are actually variations of the same thing
                    optimized for a specific data layout. By default, the table item and the crosstab item display group data in a grid layout, while the list item displays
                    detail data in a free-form layout.</span></p>
